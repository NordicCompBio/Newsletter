Fork the directory and add a new text file to the directory. 

Index the file through adding a date in YYYY-MM-DD format, before the file name. 
In the file describe: 
* The content that you wish to include
* An approximate time when you want it to be published (e.g. if you prefer to have it shared later in the year due to an opening position in your research group)
* Your contact information (name, affiliation, e-mail address), so that we can reach out to you in order to finalize the content.

Happy sharing! ðŸ¦– :bowtie:
